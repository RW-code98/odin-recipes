        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Zucchini bread is a slightly sweet quick bread (similar to a muffin), with a hint of cinnamon. 
        It's often punctuated with tender bits of walnut, like you see here in this recipe. 
        The zucchini itself is so mild, you don't even really taste it at all.</p>
