        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Zucchini bread is a slightly sweet quick bread (similar to a muffin), with a hint of cinnamon. It's often punctuated with tender bits of walnut, like you see here in this recipe. The zucchini itself is so mild, you don't even really taste it at all.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded zucchini</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, beat together the zucchini, sugar, egg, and oil. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder; stir in the cinnamon and lemon zest. Stir the flour mixture into the zucchini mixture just until blended. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from heat, and cool about 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
